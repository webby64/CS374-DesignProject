This is the source file of our prototype. 

Major frameworks used:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  - React-icons
  - React-hooks
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

We have included all the components inside src/components folder.

- The main javascript file is **App.js** which if found in src/component. This file also links different routes to different components. 

- Dashboard is the main folder which consists all the components of the group page and user profile. 
- To make a smooth communication between components, we use contexts to send user info among different components.
